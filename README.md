# Arctopsyche Population Scripts
This repository includes the scripts used to analyze silk genes in populations of Arctopsyche grandis.

## Figure 1: Alleles of single individuals from multiple species of caddisfly

`pairwise_alignment_coords.py` performs a pairwise alignment of two H-fibroin alleles and calculates the coordinates of each indel in the alignment.

`pairwise_alignment_fig.R` creates a plot of the pairwise alignment that highlights allele lenght and indel size and locations. 

## Figure 3: Indel histogram 

`pull_indels.py`: Pulls all the indels from a multiple sequence alignment and stores the lengths and counts in a table.

`plot_indel_lengths.py`: Creates a histogram of the indel lengths from the table. 

## Figure 4: Motif amino acid sequence scan 


## Figure 5: (SX)nE spacer patterns


## Supplemental figures: motif scancs and (SX)nE spacer patterns from individual alleles
